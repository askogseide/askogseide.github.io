# Hello, welcome to my portfolio!
## My name is Alexandra Skogseide and I am a Computer Science student. 

Here is a website I am currently working on [https://colour-palette-website.onrender.com/](https://colour-palette-website.onrender.com/).
It is a React application in JavaScript on the frontend (see [colour-palette-frontend](https://github.com/askogseide/colour-palette-frontend/tree/e0f5862fae4db7fedb557f08e7bb56af8136e321)) with a Flask Python application on the backend (see [colour-palette-website](https://github.com/askogseide/colour-palette-website/tree/main)).
